# (Optional) Task 3
# TODO Check for compatibility between your birth year and your friend's birth year
# NOTE: You can always assume the first input is your birth year (i.e., 1982 for me).
# This way, you are not writing a ton of code to consider every possibility.
# In other words, only do one row of the sample compatibility table.


# TODO print if you are a strong match, no match, or in between
